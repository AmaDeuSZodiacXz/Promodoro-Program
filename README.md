# Promodoro - Improve Productivity

## Introduction
Promodoro is a simple yet effective productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. The idea is to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Our application, Promodoro, brings this technique to your desktop with a user-friendly interface and customizable timer settings.

## Features
- **Custom Timer Settings:** Set work and break intervals as per your preference.
- **Audio Alerts:** Get notified with an alert sound at the end of each interval.
- **Simple UI:** Easy-to-use interface with a clean, purple-themed design.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Gain control over your intervals with pause and resume options.
- **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with various operating systems.

## Installation
To use Promodoro, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the application requires Pygame for audio functionalities. You can install Pygame using pip:


## Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies, run the `promodoro.py` script. The main window will display a timer set to 00:00 by default. You have the option to start a Pomodoro session (25 minutes) or a break session (5 minutes). The timer can be reset at any point.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`.
3. Run `promodoro.py`.
4. Click on "Start Timer" to begin a Pomodoro session or "Break Time" for a break.
